.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.br
.B command | hsh
.br
.B hsh < script

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimal shell that executes commands read from standard input. It supports
interactive and non-interactive modes, resolves commands through \fBPATH\fR,
and provides the built-ins \fBexit\fR and \fBenv\fR.

.SH MODES
.TP
Interactive
Prompts with \fI($)\fR, reads a line, executes, and repeats until \fBexit\fR or
EOF (Ctrl+D). On EOF a trailing newline is printed before exiting.
.TP
Non-interactive
Reads commands from a pipe or redirected file until EOF; no prompt is shown.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
.IP \[bu] 2
Tokens are split on spaces or tabs; no quoting or variable expansion.
.IP \[bu] 2
Absolute/relative paths are executed directly if the file exists.
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, directories in \fBPATH\fR are searched in order; the first match
is executed. If no match is found, an error is printed and status 127 is set.
.IP \[bu] 2
If a found command lacks execute permission, status 126 is set.
.IP \[bu] 2
Each external command runs in a child process via \fIfork\fR + \fIexecve\fR;
the shell waits and propagates the child's exit status.

.SH BUILT-INS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Terminate the shell with \fIstatus\fR, or with the last command's status if
no argument is given.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables, one per line.

.SH ERRORS
Errors follow the format: \fIprogram: line: command: message\fR. Examples:
\"./hsh: 3: fake: not found\" or \"./hsh: 4: ls: Permission denied\".

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with the status of the last executed command or the value
passed to \fBexit\fR. Not found commands return 127; permission errors return
126.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Interactive:
.br
.B ($) /bin/ls
.br
.B ($) exit
.TP
Non-interactive:
.br
.B echo \"/bin/ls\" | ./hsh
.br
.B printf \"env\\nexit\\n\" | ./hsh
